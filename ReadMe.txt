Builders Example
===============

Sample code that shows several ways to make tests obvious, especially by using builders. It also shows the use of builders in production code. This code demonstrates all of the following:

* Working in short movements made up of tiny commits.
* Using Arlo's Commit Notation to make risk obvious.
* How to accomplish some common design changes as a sequence of R# refactorings with no hand edits.
* The use of builders to make test data easy.
* The use of builders to adapt an overly-general API and simplify production code.
* Using custom test assertions to make intention obvious.
* Use of Culture as Code to make process changes easier to propose and easier to spread.
* Test as Spec - use of acceptance micro-tests to verify the code and communicate with stakeholders.
* Spect and change control generation based on source control history.

The end result is a coding style that results in fluid, rapid programming, yet still can be used in regulated environments to ease approval.

Use ACN
Use 3 branch prefixes
Use 3 test namespaces
Follow editorconfig settings
